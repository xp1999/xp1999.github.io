About me
======
I am currently a Ph.D. student at University of Wisconsin-Madison in [Medical Physics](https://medphysics.wisc.edu/about-us/mission-and-vision/), supervised by [Dr. Guang-Hong Chen](https://medphysics.wisc.edu/blog/staff/chen-guanghong/). My research focuses on CT imaging, particularly in Photon-Counting CT imaging. I earned my master's degree in Computer Science and bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/), where I was supervised by [Dr. Xiaochun Lai](https://bme.shanghaitech.edu.cn/bme_en/2021/0205/c8252a85055/page.htm).
